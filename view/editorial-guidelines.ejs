            Our guidelines ensure the stories you read on Gaming Tech Ware are accurate, current, and grounded in verifiable reporting.

              <h2>Source Standards</h2>
              <p>
                We rely on primary sources such as publisher announcements, regulatory filings, transcripts, and interviews. Secondary sources are cited only when they add new reporting or context unavailable elsewhere.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Every claim must trace back to a publicly accessible document or on-the-record statement.</li>
                <li>Anonymous or speculative reports are labelled clearly and treated with caution.</li>
                <li>Rumors are excluded unless the originating outlet has a proven track record and we can corroborate key details.</li>

              <h2>Accuracy Checks</h2>
              <p>
                Before publishing, editors confirm names, dates, units of measurement, currencies, and geographic references. We maintain internal notes for each article outlining the evidence supporting major claims.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we cannot validate a data point, we omit it or note that the information is unverified. We do not knowingly publish promotional copy or marketing language without context.

              <h2>Updates &amp; Corrections</h2>
              <p>
                When facts change after publication, we update the article as soon as new primary reporting is available. Substantive corrections add a note at the bottom of the story explaining what changed and when.
              </p>
              <p>
                Readers can request a correction or clarification by emailing <a href="mailto:<%= contactEmail %>"><%= contactEmail %></a>. We review each request within two business days.

              <h2>AI &amp; Automation Policy</h2>
              <p>
                Automated tools help us gather leads and draft copy, but every published article is edited by a human. Editors verify facts, adjust tone for clarity, and ensure the story reflects our guidelines before it goes live.
