              <h2>How We Work</h2>
              <p>
                Articles start with trusted feeds and first-party statements. Our editors validate key claims, verify citations, and produce fresh copy that reflects the evolving facts of each story. We update posts when new information appears.
              </p>
              <p>
                We apply the same review checklist to every rewrite: confirm the primary source, cross-check numbers, contextualize timelines, and flag speculation. When we cannot confirm a claim, we either omit it or explain the uncertainty.
